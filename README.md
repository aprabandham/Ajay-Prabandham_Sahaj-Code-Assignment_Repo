Solution codebase repo for Sahaj Code Assignment - as part of Ajay Prabandham's Interview Process

Issues:
1. I'm still completing Game 5:  "Fastest-Early-Five" - tests are failing there. 
2. Need to make the output logging cleaner and more user friendly. 

If you're curious to download and execute what's committed currently, please do the following:

1. Go into the *tambola_claim_validator* directory, which has gherkin/, tests/, and src/ sub-dirs.
2. here, run *pip install -r requirements.txt*
3. Next, run *pytest* - which executes all the unit tests.

As recommended:

1. I've followed TDD
2. The E2E demonstration - inputs are of the form of a set of Unit test files - 5 of them, one for each kind og Tambola Game Simulator.
3. The relevant output log files will appear in the logs/ folder, on running the tests.
